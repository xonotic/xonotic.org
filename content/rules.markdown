##### Usage of AI

Content generated with AI has to be visibly marked accordingly. This includes images, messages/posts and code.

In addition to a general "AI" marking, the following information is preferred:

- Service/Technology
- Model name and date
- Prompt

While it is not necessary to mark AI transformation tools (e.g translations, gramar corrections etc), it is advised as they can sometimes change the underlying meaning.
