## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Team Xonotic's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
information we collect from you across our web properties https://stats.xonotic.org and
https://forums.xonotic.org, along with any other sites we own and operate. We comply with 
[the general data protection regulation][gdpr] (GDPR) and other relevant laws to the best of our ability.

This document describes how we process data that can be considered personal data when you make use of our
player statistics system and other web properties. If you have any questions about how we handle user
data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

### Who is responsible for processing your data?

Controller in terms of the GDPR is Team Xonotic. The primary point of contact for reaching this team is
the email address `admin` at `xonotic.org`. 

Team Xonotic runs services which may collect and process data related to our users. We only collect data
when we truly need it to provide a service to you and the community at large. Team Xonotic does not use
personal data for commercial purposes. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and,
where required, with your consent via configurable, in-game options.


### What data is collected, and why?

1. When you connect to a web property on xonotic.org, data is temporarily collected by the web servers to
   service your requests. Your IP address is included in this data set, and is used to
   maintain your connection to the site. It is also used to identify potential cybersecurity
   attacks on our infrastructure. Data of this nature is not retained permanently. It instead is
   rotated out on a weekly basis.
2. Our forum software requires you to disclose personal information before you can obtain an
   account. This information includes a username and email address, and is used to communicate
   with you through the forum's messaging and notification systems. Session cookies are also used
   to persist your session (your authentication) across different visits from your browser and even across different
   pages.
3. Xonotic offers player's statistics to be tracked and displayed on stats.xonotic.org ("Xonstat"). 
   When playing on a server that sends statistical data to Xonstat, your playing activities
   (win/loss, frags, deaths, flag captures, weapon accuracy, damage dealt and the like) are being
   sent to Xonstat. By default, this information is sent anonymously and without reference to your
   user ID or the nick you have chosen. Your participation in a match recorded to Xonstat will then 
   show your nick as "Anonymous Player" without a statistics profile behind it. Should you choose to
   activate player statistics via the menu (the cvar governing this is "cl_allow_uidtracking"), you
   consent to your user ID being sent by the server you play on to Xonstat, where your playing activity
   will be recorded under the profile "Anonymous Player" followed by your user ID. If you activate
   "show your name" (check whether this is actually the right term) (the cvar governing this is
   "cl_allow_uid2name"), the nick you have chosen at the time of the end of the match will be included
   in the match's statistic. (To be continued)
   
   ...your data will be included in
   game submissions from that server when you play. This includes information about your client and your
   performance in the game itself: frags, deaths, flag captures, weapon accuracy, and the like. This data
   is retained indefinitely for purposes of recording historical match information for later review
   by members of the player base. Although this information is not personal in nature, we do
   support anonymization of client data upon request. 

We retain the collected information for as long as necessary to provide you and the community at
large with the requested service. We will protect that data with all means at our disposal to avoid 
unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. In such cases where data sets are
released to the public, we will ensure that they are anonymized such that client-identifiable key 
information is no longer present.

### Who has access to your data?

Your data is stored on computers secured by a professional hosting provider in the European Union.
Team Xonotic members can access this data according to their roles in the community. For example,
forum administrators can see metadata behind all forum posts and system administrators are able to
see raw web server logs. We restrict team member access to those necessary for them to effectively perform
their roles.

We donâ€™t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when
required to by law.

### What rights do I have over data collected?

1. Right of access

You can ask us for confirmation if your personal data is or is not being processed. We can assist
you retrieving this data upon request. This will likely involve utilization of web APIs.

2. Right to rectification

You can ask us to fix data we have collected about you if you believe it to be inaccurate,
incomplete, or not needed. 

3. Right to withdraw consent

At any time you may withdraw your consent to data collection for one or more of our services. We
will stop processing your data as soon as the request is received.

4. Right to erasure or anonymization

You can ask us to erase the data collected about you. The team reserves the right to implement 
complete and irreversible anonymization instead of erasure in order to maintain the integrity of
some services.


This policy is effective as of 17 November 2021.
